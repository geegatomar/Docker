# Learning Docker

* Pulled docker images of node and mysql
* Using Dockerfile, Made an image from node, called new_app
* Wrote the .yaml files and mapped ports 8080 for node and 3306 for mySQL
* Wrote a basic .js file which on getting http request, responses with 'Hello World' to the browser
* Docker composed the container with new_app and mysql together
* To verify if its running, I entered the docker container using 'exec -t' and then checked for required files in the given locations
* Also checked if ports are listening correctly using netstat command
</ul>


### To do further

* Learn Javascript and the required APIs to handle SQL queries.
